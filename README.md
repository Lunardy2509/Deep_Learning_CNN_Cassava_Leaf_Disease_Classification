# Deep_Learning_CNN_Cassava_Leaf_Disease_Classification
This is my final-term exam of the Machine Learning Course. The main objective is to create deep learning AI using CNN methodology to classify cassava leaf disease into five various classes. Disclaimer: I took the data from the Kaggle dataset, you may find it in open source and it's free. 
Here is the train and test zip file of the cassava leaf: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1R2SgN3_GF3u0vOpAeZew03qosFZnyTHs?usp=sharing
